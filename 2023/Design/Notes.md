# Starting from Scrath
- Start with a feature, not a layout
- Details comes later
    - Hold the color
    - Don't over invest
- Don't design too much
  - Work in cycles: Design, code, design, code...
  - Be a pessimist: Design only features you're implementing right now
- Choose a personality based on: font, color, border radius, language
- Limit your choices
  - Define systems in advance for:
    - color
    - font (size, weight)
    - line height
    - margin 
    - padding
    - width
    - height
    - box shadows
    - border width
    - opacity
    - extra things you run into
  - Design by process of elimination: choose the middle out of 3

# Hierarchy is Everything
- Not all elements are equal (Visual Hierarchy)
- Size isn't everything (use also font weight and color)
  - Color: dark, grey, lighter gray
  - Font weight: normal, heavier
- Don't use grey text on colored backgrounds
  - Hand-pick a new color based on bg color. 
  - Same hue, adjust only saturation and lightness
  - Text should not look faded
- Emphasize by de-emphasizing
- Labels are a last resort
  - You might not need a label at all
  - Combine labels and values
  - Labels are secondary (in case you need them)
  - Only emphasize label if you know user will look for it
- Separate visual hierarchy from document hierarchy
- Balance weight and contrast
  - Using contrast to compansate for weight (for icons example)
  - Using weight to compansate for contrast (for border example)
- Semantics are secondary (design by hierarchy)
  - Primary actions: should be obvious: solid, hight contrast bg colors are good options
  - Secondary actions: should be clear but not prominent: outline styles or lower contrast bg colors are good options
  - Tertiary actions: should be discoverable but unobstusive. Basic link styling is good option
  - Destructive actions: you can give secondary or tertiary design and add a confirmation step, where the desctructive action is the primary action

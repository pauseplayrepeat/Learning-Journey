# Starting from Scrath
- Start with a feature, not a layout
- Details comes later
    - Hold the color
    - Don't over invest
- Don't design too much
  - Work in cycles: Design, code, design, code...
  - Be a pessimist: Design only features you're implementing right now
- Choose a personality based on: font, color, border radius, language
- Limit your choices
  - Define systems in advance for:
    - color
    - font (size, weight)
    - line height
    - margin 
    - padding
    - width
    - height
    - box shadows
    - border width
    - opacity
    - extra things you run into
  - Design by process of elimination: choose the middle out of 3

# Hierarchy is Everything
- Not all elements are equal (Visual Hierarchy)
- Size isn't everything (use also font weight and color)
  - Color: dark, grey, lighter gray
  - Font weight: normal, heavier
- Don't use grey text on colored backgrounds
  - Hand-pick a new color based on bg color. 
  - Same hue, adjust only saturation and lightness
  - Text should not look faded
- Emphasize by de-emphasizing
- Labels are a last resort
  - You might not need a label at all
  - Combine labels and values
  - Labels are secondary (in case you need them)
  - Only emphasize label if you know user will look for it
- Separate visual hierarchy from document hierarchy
- Balance weight and contrast
  - Using contrast to compansate for weight (for icons example)
  - Using weight to compansate for contrast (for border example)
- Semantics are secondary (design by hierarchy)
  - Primary actions: should be obvious: solid, hight contrast bg colors are good options
  - Secondary actions: should be clear but not prominent: outline styles or lower contrast bg colors are good options
  - Tertiary actions: should be discoverable but unobstusive. Basic link styling is good option
  - Destructive actions: you can give secondary or tertiary design and add a confirmation step, where the desctructive action is the primary action

# Layout and Spacing
- Start with too much white space
  - White space should be removed not added
  - Dense UIs have their place (dashboards, deliberate decision)
- Establish a spacing and sizing system
  - A linear scale won't work (>25%)
  - Defining the systems (spacing and sizing): start with a default value 16px is commonly used
    - 4px (16 x 0.25)
    - 8px (16 x 0.5)
    - 16px (16 x 1)
    - 32px (16 x 2)
    - 64px (16 x 4)
    - 96px (16 x 6)
    - 128px (16 x 8)
    - 192px (16 x 12)
    - 256px (16 x 16)
    - 384px (16 x 24)
    - 512px (16 x 32)
    - 640px (16 x 40)
    - 768px (16 x 48)
- You don't have to fill the whole screen (only the space it needs)
  - Shrink the canvas (mobile first for web responsive apps)
  - Thinking in columns
  - Don't force it (Don't cramp everything)
- Grids are overrated
  - Not all elements should be fluid
  - Don't shrink an element until you need to
- Relative sizing doesn't scale
  - Relationships within elements
- Avoid ambiguous spacing

# Design Text
- Establish a type scale
  - Modular scales: hand crafted, just like spacing and sizing
  - Avoid em units
- Use good fonts
  - Play it safe
  - Ignore typefaces with less than five weights
  - Steal from people who care
- Keep your line length in check
  - 45 to 75 characters per line (easist with em)
  - Dealing with wider content (don't ocupy the entire space)
- Baseline, not center
- Line-height is proportional
  - 1.5 is a good place to start (don't use it everywhere)
  - Accounting for line length (wider -> bigger)
  - Accounting for font size (small -> bigger)
- Not every link needs a color (can be only on hover)
- Align with readability in mind
  - Don't center long form text
  - Right-align numbers
  - Hyphenate justified text
- Use letter-spacing effectively
  - Tightening headlines
  - Improving all-caps legibility (increase by 0.05em)
